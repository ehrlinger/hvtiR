Package: hvtiR
Version: 1.0.1

## hvtiR 1.0.1

* **The package is renamed from `hvtiverse` to `hvtiR`**, matching the `hvtiR*`
  prefix the rest of the family uses. Install from `ehrlinger/hvtiR`.
* **Every exported function is renamed**, dropping the package-name prefix that
  no other family package carries. The package is meant to be called with `::`
  rather than attached:

  | was | now |
  |---|---|
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_install()` | `hvtiR::install()` |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_update()`  | `hvtiR::update()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_status()`  | `hvtiR::status()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_doctor()`  | `hvtiR::doctor()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_members()` | `hvtiR::members()` |

* The class returned by `status()` is renamed `hvtiR_status`. Unlike the
  functions it stays package-qualified, because S3 classes are matched by
  string and a bare `status` class would collide.
* No deprecated aliases are provided. `hvtiverse` 1.0.0 was never depended on
  outside this family, so there is nothing to migrate.


## hvtiverse 1.0.0

* First release.
* `hvtiverse_install()` installs all 11 members of the HVTI R package family
  from GitHub in a single `pak` call.
* `hvtiverse_update()` installs only the members that are missing or out of
  date, and refuses to overwrite a member whose namespace is already loaded.
* `hvtiverse_status()` reports installed against latest versions for every
  member.
* `hvtiverse_doctor()` adds R version and platform checks for diagnosing an
  installation that will not work.
* `hvtiverse_members()` exposes the registry.
