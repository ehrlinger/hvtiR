Package: hvtiR
Version: 1.0.3

## hvtiR 1.0.3

* `status()` now detects an older GitHub installation when its version matches
  `main` but pak's recorded `RemoteSha` does not. The member reports as
  `"stale"`, so `update()` reinstalls it. Installs without GitHub commit
  provenance continue to use version comparison alone.
* Commit checks use GitHub's public Atom feeds rather than its rate-limited
  API. A failed commit check reports `"unknown"` and its reason is retained
  for `doctor()`.

## hvtiR 1.0.2

* Remote version checks now use a five-second connection timeout and retain
  per-repository failure reasons for `doctor()` to report.
* `doctor()` now reports whether `pak` is available before showing member
  status.
* Documentation now explains GitHub as the family's leading release source
  without hard-coded CRAN or GitHub versions, and the offline vignette example
  uses the qualified `hvtiR::status()` call.
* The pkgdown site is validated on pull requests with read-only permissions,
  and deployments remove pages retired by the `hvtiverse` to `hvtiR` rename.
* Source-package tarballs and linked-worktree Git metadata are excluded from
  package builds.

## hvtiR 1.0.1

* **The package is renamed from `hvtiverse` to `hvtiR`**, matching the `hvtiR*`
  prefix the rest of the family uses. Install from `ehrlinger/hvtiR`.
* **Every exported function is renamed**, dropping the package-name prefix that
  no other family package carries. The package is meant to be called with `::`
  rather than attached:

  | was | now |
  |---|---|
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_install()` | `hvtiR::install()` |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_update()`  | `hvtiR::update()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_status()`  | `hvtiR::status()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_doctor()`  | `hvtiR::doctor()`  |
  | `hvtiverse::hvtiverse_members()` | `hvtiR::members()` |

* The class returned by `status()` is renamed `hvtiR_status`. Unlike the
  functions it stays package-qualified, because S3 classes are matched by
  string and a bare `status` class would collide.
* No deprecated aliases are provided. `hvtiverse` 1.0.0 was never depended on
  outside this family, so there is nothing to migrate.


## hvtiverse 1.0.0

* First release.
* `hvtiverse_install()` installs all 11 members of the HVTI R package family
  from GitHub in a single `pak` call.
* `hvtiverse_update()` installs only the members that are missing or out of
  date, and refuses to overwrite a member whose namespace is already loaded.
* `hvtiverse_status()` reports installed against latest versions for every
  member.
* `hvtiverse_doctor()` adds R version and platform checks for diagnosing an
  installation that will not work.
* `hvtiverse_members()` exposes the registry.
